*MediVoice* 
MediVoice is a voice-activated medication reminder web application designed to help users manage their medication schedules easily and hands-free. Using speech recognition and text-to-speech, the app allows users to add, track, and receive medication reminders directly from their browser.

*Features*
Voice Commands – Add and manage medication reminders using natural voice input.
Text-to-Speech Alerts – Get spoken notifications when it’s time to take your medicine.
Local Storage Support – Reminders are saved in the browser and persist across sessions.
Lightweight & Fast – Runs fully on the browser with no backend required.

*how it works*
User interacts with the app via voice commands (e.g., “Remind me to take medicine at 8 PM” or “What’s the weather today?”).
The app processes the input using the Web Speech API.
For reminders → It stores the data in localStorage and triggers voice notifications at the scheduled time.
For weather → It fetches live data from the Weather API and displays it on-screen with up-to-date information.
Users can view, edit, or delete reminders anytime.
