MediVoice 
MediVoice is a voice-activated medication reminder web application designed to help users manage their medication schedules easily and hands-free. Using speech recognition and text-to-speech, the app allows users to add, track, and receive medication reminders directly from their browser.

Features
Voice Commands – Add and manage medication reminders using natural voice input.
Text-to-Speech Alerts – Get spoken notifications when it’s time to take your medicine.
Local Storage Support – Reminders are saved in the browser and persist across sessions.
Lightweight & Fast – Runs fully on the browser with no backend required.

how it works
User interacts with the app via voice commands (e.g., “Remind me to take medicine at 8 PM”).
The app processes the input using the Web Speech API and stores it in localStorage.
At the scheduled time, the app triggers a voice notification and on-screen alert.
Users can view, edit, or delete reminders at any time.
